# Philippines Historical Disaster Patterns and Statistics

## Geographic Vulnerability

The Philippines is hit on average by more than 20 tropical storms a year and is prone to both earthquakes and volcanoes.  Being situated along the "Ring of Fire" and the "Typhoon Belt", the Philippines is exposed to tropical storms and usually suffers from various natural disasters and calamities such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and flooding. 

### Risk Index Rankings

Based on the 2018 World Risk Report, the Philippines ranked third in terms of disaster risk index, with highest risks being earthquakes (10 risk index points) and tropical cyclones (9.5 risk index points). 

## Major Historical Typhoons (2009-2024)

### 1. Typhoon Yolanda/Haiyan (2013) - Most Destructive

Super typhoon Haiyan, one of the most powerful typhoons in history, struck the Philippines on November 8, 2013, as a Category 5 storm with wind speeds above 157 mph and sustained winds of over 150 mph. 

**Impact Statistics:**
- By April 17, 2016, the NDRRMC confirmed 6,300 fatalities across the country, 5,902 of those taking place in the Eastern Visayas. 
- The typhoon affected more than 14 million people across 44 provinces, displacing millions more. 
- Damage worth ₱95.5 billion pesos, making it the #1 strongest typhoon in Philippine history. 
- Storm surge reached more than five metres high in some areas, including Tacloban. Four million people saw their homes severely damaged or destroyed. 

### 2. Typhoon Ondoy/Ketsana (2009) - Urban Flooding

Former President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo described Ondoy as a "once-in-a-lifetime typhoon" with 464 dead, 529 injured, and 37 missing, affecting nearly a million families or close to five million people. 

**Metro Manila Impact:**
- Flood disasters affected 872,097 people throughout the entire metropolitan area, causing 241 fatalities, 394 injuries, and damaging 65,521 buildings (12,563 completely destroyed). Infrastructure damages amounted to 570,187,587 Philippine pesos. 

### 3. Typhoon Ulysses/Vamco (2020) - Recent Major Flood

Ulysses brought more devastation, causing the worst flooding in Metro Manila since Typhoon Ondoy in 2009. 

**2020 Impact:**
- Death toll of 73, with 68 injured, and 19 missing people across all affected areas as of November 21, 2020. 
- In Kasiglahan Village, Vamco inundated 8,000 out of 14,000 homes–double the coverage of Ondoy. 

### 4. Typhoon Rolly/Goni (2020) - Strongest of 2020

Rolly developed into a super typhoon with sustained winds of 315 km/h, making it one of the top 10 strongest typhoons in the Philippines and the world's strongest typhoon in 2020. 

**Statistics:**
- Death toll of 25, with 399 injured and 6 missing persons. 

### 5. Other Significant Typhoons

**Typhoon Pepeng/Parma (2009):**
- Death toll of 465 people and damage worth ₱27.3 billion, occurring just days after Ondoy. 

**Typhoon Pablo/Bopha (2012):**
- Devastated Mindanao, triggering landslides that killed more than 1,000 people in affected southern provinces. 

## Typhoon Season Patterns

### Annual Frequency
- The Philippines is hit by 20 typhoons per year on average. 
- 2020 saw multiple destructive typhoons with Ulysses being the most destructive, followed by Rolly, Quinta, Ambo, Vicky, Pepito, Ofel, and Marce. 

### Seasonal Timing
- Peak typhoon season: June to November
- Late-season storms (October-November) often most destructive
- Ketsana-level typhoons are expected to hit the Philippines every 10 years, but the country's weather station anticipates fewer but stronger typhoons due to erratic weather patterns. 

## Flood Vulnerability Areas

### Metro Manila Risk Zones
Flooding is particularly severe across wide flood plains along the Upper Marikina River, low-lying areas along the Pasig, Malabon-Tullahan, Parañaque-Las Piñas, and Meycauayan Rivers, as well as coastal areas and shores of Laguna Lake. 

### Sea Level Rise Impact
Manila Bay's sea level has been rising four times faster than the rest of the world. The city's land is anticipated to sink by two meters by 2060 due to ground subsidence caused by groundwater extraction. 

## Damage Trends and Improvements

### Casualty Reduction Progress
Fatalities caused by natural disasters in the Philippines have been on the decline since a peak in 2013 during Typhoon Yolanda. The combined casualties of Super Typhoons Rolly and Ulysses compared to Typhoons Ondoy and Haiyan are much lower. 

### Economic Impact
A Post-Disaster Needs Assessment conducted after recent storms estimated total damage and losses equivalent to about 2.7 percent of GDP, with affected regions accounting for 60 percent of the country's GDP. 

## Climate Change Multiplier Effects

The situation is challenging because of the multiplier effect of "climate change" and "man-made" activities destructive to the environment like illegal logging, irresponsible mining, and irresponsible quarrying. 

The Huffington Post noted that 70% deforestation of the Philippines since 1900 made far more lethal flooding from cyclones like Haiyan more likely.
