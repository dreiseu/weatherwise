# Philippine DRRM Protocols and Framework

## National Framework Overview

The Updated National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Plan (NDRRMP) 2020-2030 establishes the linkage between disaster risk reduction and management (DRRM), climate change adaptation (CCA), and human security by focusing on climate and disaster risks.  

### Key Governance Structure

The National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC), formerly known as the National Disaster Coordinating Council (NDCC), is a working group of various government, non-government, civil sector and private sector organizations established by Republic Act 10121 of 2010. 

### Legal Foundation

Republic Act No. 10121 strengthens the Philippine Disaster Risk Reduction and Management System, providing for the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Framework and institutionalizing the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Plan. 

## Local Government Responsibilities  

Provincial, city and municipal DRRMOs or BDRRMCs shall perform functions including: designing, programming, and coordinating disaster risk reduction activities; facilitating risk assessments and contingency planning; consolidating local disaster risk information; organizing training activities; and operating multi-hazard early warning systems. 

### LDRRMO Structure

The LDRRMO shall be under the office of the governor, city or municipal mayor, and shall be initially organized and composed of a DRRMO assisted by three staff responsible for: (1) administration and training; (2) research and planning; and (3) operations and warning. 

## Four Thematic Pillars

The NDRRMP sets down the expected outcomes, outputs, key activities, indicators, lead agencies, implementing partners and timelines under four distinct yet mutually reinforcing thematic areas. 

1. **Prevention and Mitigation**
2. **Preparedness** 
3. **Response**
4. **Rehabilitation and Recovery**

## Funding Requirements

All departments/agencies and LGUs allocated with DRRM fund shall submit monthly statements on utilization of DRRM funds. The OCD shall be allocated a budget of One billion pesos (Php 1,000,000,000.00) revolving fund. 

## Sector-Specific DRRM

### Agriculture Sector

The agriculture and fisheries sector has set up the Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Section (DRRMS) with key strategies including: establishing operational policy framework, coordinating DRRM activities, developing GIS-based information systems, and conducting rapid damage assessments. 

## Integration with Climate Change

The framework aims to achieve shared goals of Ambisyon Natin 2040, NDRRMP, National Climate Change Action Plan (NCCAP), and National Security Strategy (NSS) in risk reduction, resilience building, human security, and sustainable development. 

## International Alignment

The framework ensures coherence with global frameworks including:
- Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030
- Paris Agreement 
- UN Sustainable Development Goals 2015-2030
- ASEAN Agreement on Disaster Management and Emergency Response
