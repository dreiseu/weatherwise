# Disaster Response Guidelines and Warning Systems

## PAGASA Warning System Structure

### Primary Warning Authority
The major services provided by PAGASA include the provision of weather forecasts and tropical cyclone warnings, flood bulletins and advisories, hydrological, climatological and farm weather forecasts. 

### Flood Warning Protocols

**General Flood Advisory:**
A General Flood Advisory is simplified flood bulletin issued for non-telemetered river basins whenever there is significant rainfall recorded based on past/current observation and forecast rainfall. It is issued to the public on a regional basis through NDRRMC at 7:00am and 7:00pm. 

**River Basin Monitoring:**
River Basins with fully automatic data transmission equipped with telecommunication systems include Pampanga, Agno, Bicol, Cagayan and Cagayan De Oro, with flood forecasts prepared twice daily during floodwatch. 

## Flood Forecasting and Warning System for Dam Operations (FFWSDO)

### System Components
The FFWSDO aims at establishment of telemetered flood forecasting warning system that provides necessary information for safe and cost effective operation of existing five major dams in Luzon and to forewarn people in flood plains downstream during typhoons. 

**Key Agencies:**
Implemented with National Power Corporation (NPC) and National Irrigation Administration (NIA) as cooperating agencies and PAGASA as lead agency. Monitoring agencies include Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH), Office of Civil Defense (OCD) and National Water Resource Board (NWRB). 

### Warning Station Types
Type-A warning stations are installed in the most densely populated area of each municipality. Type-B warning stations are equipped with speaker only and installed in barangays between Type-A station coverage. Warning vehicles with speakers and radio telephones are provided for areas not reached by fixed stations. 

## Local Flood Early Warning Systems (LFEWS)

### Community-Based Approach
Local Flood Early Warning Systems (LFEWS) are called Community-Based or Community Managed or simply Local FEWS to distinguish them from big centralized FEWS run by PAGASA central office. The technical set-up is less sophisticated and much cheaper with operations center based in or near flood-prone areas. 

### Implementation Scale
In cooperation with Philippine partners including local government units, DOST and PAGASA, GIZ has implemented 16 LFEWS in twelve provinces across the country, benefiting 750,000 people since 2007. 

### Recent Expansions
PAGASA launches additional Flood Early Warning Systems (FEWS) under "Strengthening the Capability of the Republic of the Philippines on Disaster Risk Reduction" project, a grant from South Korea's National Disaster Management and Research Institute (NDMI). 

## Real-Time Monitoring Systems

### PANaHON System
PAGASA National Hydro-Met Observing Network (PANaHON) provides users with dynamic, interactive view of weather patterns using advanced forecast models, though it should not be regarded as official advisory or warning from PAGASA. 

### Current Alert Examples
Thunderstorm Advisory and Heavy Rainfall Warning systems provide real-time alerts for moderate to heavy rainshowers with lightning, strong winds, and flooding possibilities in specific provinces and municipalities. 

## Warning Dissemination Protocols

### Communication Chain
Discharge/Flood warning notices are transmitted from Dam Offices to municipal halls which serve as centers for dissemination of warnings. All flood warning operations are undertaken in close coordination with FFWS Dam Offices, PAGASA and other government agencies. 

### Multi-Channel Approach
Multi-hazard early warning systems provide accurate and timely advice to national or local emergency response organizations and general public through diverse mass media, particularly radio, landline communications, and technologies. 

## Response Coordination Structure

### National Level Response
The NDRRMC coordinates disaster response through lead agencies and implementing partners with specific timelines and indicators for each thematic area. 

### Local Response Teams
LDRRMOs and BDRRMCs shall organize, train and directly supervise local emergency response teams and Accredited Community Disaster Volunteers (ACDVs). 

## Evacuation Protocols

### Pre-Disaster Measures
Officials placed police officers in affected regions ahead of storms. In provinces of Samar and Leyte, classes were canceled, and residents in flood- and landslide-prone areas were required to evacuate. 

### Military Deployment
Philippine President requested military to deploy planes and helicopters to regions expected to be affected, with PAGASA issuing warnings at different levels to about 60 of the 80 provinces. 

## International Coordination

### Space-Based Support
The International Charter on Space and Major Disasters was activated, providing widespread charitable satellite coverage to relief organizations. 

### Regional Cooperation
Integration with ASEAN Agreement on Disaster Management and Emergency Response frameworks for cross-border coordination.

## Technology Integration

### Radar Systems
Development of Radar Quantitative Precipitation Estimation (QPE) allows identification and measurement of rainfall levels during radar observation, developed through collaborative efforts between DOST-PAGASA and Central Weather Bureau. 

### Data Collection Operations
Flood forecasting and warning operations include: collection of hydrometeorological data on real-time basis, real-time processing for flood forecasting, and coordinated warning dissemination. 

## Response Effectiveness Improvements

### Zero-Casualty Goal
The objective of the Philippine government is to have a zero-casualty index, with significant improvements shown in recent typhoon responses compared to historical disasters. 

### Enhanced Preparedness
There's more government risk reduction expenditure and attention since Typhoon Yolanda, with combined casualties of recent super typhoons being much lower than previous major disasters. 

## Challenges and Future Directions

### Infrastructure Limitations
Up to now no comprehensive guideline on how to establish and run local FEWS exists in the Philippine context, though there is growing interest in establishment of local and low-cost FEWS. 

### Climate Adaptation Needs
Increasing focus on climate change adaptation measures integrated with traditional disaster response protocols to address changing weather patterns and intensification of storms.
